## Font Awesome Extended

Extension classes for Font Awesome that expose icons already existing in the Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs unicode block of the Font Awesome font.

Please note that these icons and their corresponding classes are **untested** by yours truly and therefore they may not work in some and/or all browsers. 

Please see the [demo page](https://gotdibbs.github.io/Font-Awesome-Extended/) for examples.

### Usage

1. Download the CSS file `css\font-awesome-x.css` or `css\font-awesome-x.min.css` from this repository.
2. Reference it after Font Awesome.
3. Use the extension classes as you would any other Font Awesome class such as `<i class="fa fax-palm-tree"></i>`. All the names will be as per the unicode spec but with spaces replaced with hyphens.
4. Profit.

### Build

The build is setup to run on invocation of Visual Studio Code's build command, but you can also just run `node src\scrape.js`.
